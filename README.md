In this project, we demonstrate the capabilities of the Lumiere OpenAI Assistant using a Flask web application that connects with OpenAI's API for data file processing and generation. Users can upload files and input context via an intuitive interface. The application communicates with OpenAI to produce datasets in Parquet format and displays the initial rows of the output.
